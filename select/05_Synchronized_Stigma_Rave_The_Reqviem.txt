God save me!
Self-mortification
Is the way to stay alive
Without pain!
Our love will perish

God save me!
The Original Sin
Is kept alive
When you and I!
Justify hatred for mankind

This double-edged dagger's
Going straight through our hearts
It's the birth of every action
Ending up in tearing us apart
So what's the point in diplomacy?
We've already become our arch enemies
Died and resurrected!

(Lord, deliver us)
She stands above and I crawl beneath
(Lord, deliver us)
She crushes my head and I bite her feet
(Lord, deliver us)
Six thousand years' enough
I spit out your forbidden fruit
Now let me die here alone

God save me!
All hope is gone
But our will to stay alive
Clinging to life!
Like a leech in Heaven

God save me!
Every word we say
Every breath we take
Proves us worthy!
Of a new Biblical plague!

Two demons intertwined
By fear and regret
We're the perfect symbiosis
Of self-loathing and neglect
It doesnt matter
If we repair this or not
I guess we all forgot
Two wrongs don't make a right!

(Lord, deliver us)
She stands above and I crawl beneath
(Lord, deliver us)
She crushes my head and I bite her feet
(Lord, deliver us)
Six thousand years' enough
I spit out your forbidden fruit
Now let me die here alone
(Lord, deliver us)
She stands above and I crawl beneath
(Lord, deliver us)
She crushes my head and I bite her feet
(Lord, deliver us)
Six thousand years' enough
I spit out your forbidden fruit
Now let me die here alone

"Sign my death with your teeth"
"Sign my death with your teeth"
"Sign my death with your teeth"
"Sign my death with your teeth"

(Lord, deliver us)
She stands above and I crawl beneath
(Lord, deliver us)
She crushes my head and I bite her feet
(Lord, deliver us)
Six thousand years' enough
I spit out your forbidden fruit
Now let me die here alone
(Lord, deliver us)
She stands above and I crawl beneath
(Lord, deliver us)
She crushes my head and I bite her feet
(Lord, deliver us)
Six thousand years' enough
I spit out your forbidden fruit
Now let me die here alone
